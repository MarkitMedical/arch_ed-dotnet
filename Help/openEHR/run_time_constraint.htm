<h1>Run time constraint</h1>
<p>The run time constraint is a code or surrogate that can be bound to external terminologies. Filling in a name here creates an 'acXXXX' code in the archetype
that can then be bound to an external terminology.</p>
<p>The actual constraint must be expressed in terms of the terminology to which it is bound. There is at present no standard for this, although the HL7 CTS is
working towards achieving this.</p>
