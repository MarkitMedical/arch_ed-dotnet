<h1>Archetype paths</h1>
Archetype paths are a feature of the <span style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR
archetype system and enable data points to be identified. Further, the
are related to XPath statements, so if the data is stored as XML it is
easier to build tools to access the data.<br>
Paths have a particular feature, similar to paths used in file systems,
that require the 'run time' path to be unique. This means that every
piece of data located within a Composition (and for that matter within
an EHR) has a unique path. This enables referencing of all data using
run time paths, and all data points using the archetype path.<br>
<h2>Paths within a particular archetype</h2>
When you build an archetype, you are creating the paths without
realising it - it is a built in feature of the archetype tools. To view
the paths you can:<br>
<ul>
  <li>Use the Archetype Workbench available from <span
 style="font-style: italic;">open</span>EHR and Ocean Informatics</li>
  <li>Go to the Terminology &gt; Term Bindings Tab and move the cursor
over this prepresentation of the archetype.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="RunTime"></a>Run time paths</h2>
A run time path is created at run time - that is to say it only exists
in the data itself. If a data point has a maximum occurrence of 1, then
the archetype path is sufficient to locate the information (as no
matter what the labelling - it can be identified from the archetype
node ID which is stored with the data. However, if there are more than
one occurrence, then the run time name will identify the data instance.
This means that all run time labels (which the user sees) have to be
different if they occur at the same point.<br>
<h3>Example</h3>
In <span style="font-weight: bold;">microbiology</span> - the
antibiotic to which the sensitivities relate may be repeated as many
times as required:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Penicillin - Sensitive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amoxycillin - Sensitive<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trimethoprim - Resistant<br>
The archetype path has a place holder (atXXXX code) for the antibiotic,
but the data is identified by the actual label used at run time.<br>
<br>
In a query where you wanted to know all the antibiotic sensitivities -
you would use the archetype path. To recover information about
sensitivities to a particular antibiotic, you would need to use the run
time path which would include the representation of 'Penicillin'.<br>
