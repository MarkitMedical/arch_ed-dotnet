<h1>Constraint definitions and bindings</h1>
<p>Archetypes have a close <a href="terminology_and_archetypes.htm">relationship
with terminologies</a> - but there is no primacy of any particular terminology
in the archetype system.</p>
<p>Constraint definitions are text - in each available language - which describe
(loosely) the sort of terms that would be appropriate at this data point. An 'acXXXX'
code is generated in the archetype definition as a surrogate for this statement.</p>
<p>This definition can then be bound to any terminology - by a constraint
definition. There is, at the time of writing, no standardised way of describing
a set of terms within a terminology - but this is changing. A constraint binding
is a statement that will return the set of legal terms or phrases that can be
added to the data at this point in the archetype.</p>
