<h1>When to use an ENTRY</h1>
<p>An <a href="entry_classes.htm">ENTRY</a> is the 'semantic unit' of
information. If you are trying to represent information that can be grouped
together usefully and re-used in many different settings - then you are probably
want to use an Entry. The information within an Entry will mean the same thing
no matter where it is used - this is a fundamental design feature of the <i>open</i>EHR
architecture.</p>
<p>Examples of Entries are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blood pressure - systemic arterial blood pressure</li>
  <li>Intravascular pressure - pressure at a point within the vascular system</li>
  <li>Weight - the weight of the whole body</li>
  <li>ECG measurement</li>
  <li>Pulse</li>
  <li>Medication order</li>
  <li>Diagnosis</li>
</ul>
<p>Within the <i>open</i>EHR reference model, the concept of ENTRY - which is
shared with CEN EHR standard (13606) and the HL7 CDA is sub-typed into 3
classes. If you want to archetype an ENTRY then you will need to consider which
of the following sub-types you want to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="evaluation_when.htm">When to use an Evaluation</a></li>
  <li><a href="observation_when.htm">When to use an Observation</a></li>
  <li><a href="instruction_when.htm">When to use an Instruction</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, if the information structure you are standardising can be reused
and always mean exactly the same thing in any setting, then you probably want to
create an archetype of an ENTRY.</p>
