<h1>COMPOSITION Class</h1>
<p>A COMPOSITION is a container class in the <i>open</i>EHR reference model - it
is the unit of committal to the EHR. That is to say, all information within the
EHR is contained within a Composition. The attributes of a composition record
who committed the composition and when - as well as other attributes which meet
key requirements. Any Composition, once committed, is retained as part of the
EHR - if it is edited or changed in any way then the changes are committed as a
new version of the Composition. Further, all information transferred from one
EHR to another is transferred as Compositions.</p>
<p>Compositions contain <a href="section.htm">SECTIONs</a> - or organising
classes, which themselves contain <a href="entry_classes.htm">ENTRYs</a>.</p>
