<h1>When to use an OBSERVATION</h1>
<p>An <a href="entry_classes.htm#observation">OBSERVATION</a> is used when the
information is derived from a direct observation, measurement or experience of
the patient or data subject. Features of data that should be recorded using the
observation class are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data may be repeatedly collected and/or recorded over a period of time,
    including within one composition</li>
  <li>The concept of an interval measurement is sensible - that is to say a
    maximum, minimum or at least a modal value makes sense</li>
</ul>
<p>All measurements, reports of symptoms, examination findings and
administrations will be stored in as an Observation.</p>
