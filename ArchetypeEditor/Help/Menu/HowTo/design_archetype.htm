<title>Designing an archetype</title>

<h1>Designing an archetype</h1>

<p>Before <a href="new_archetype.htm">creating a new archetype</a> it is worth
taking some time to consider the design principles behind <i>open</i>EHR and the
archetype methodology.</p>

<p>The first aspect to consider is that an <i>open</i>EHR health record consists
of just a few 'classes' which contain information about the patient or data
subject. The 'container classes' are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>EHR - this is the top level class and contains all information about the
    data subject.</li>
  <li>Extract - this class contains all information that is to be transferred to
    another EHR.</li>
  <li>Folder - this class allows information within an EHR to be organised.</li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/composition.htm">Composition</a> (or
    document) - this is the class that contains information committed to the EHR
    by a clinician.</li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/section.htm">Section</a> - this class
    allows information within a composition to be organised.</li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/entry_classes.htm">Entry</a> - this class
    contains meaningful information that is to be processed by the machine and
    read by the clinician.</li>
</ul>

<p>These classes contain no clinical or demographic concepts at all - and it is
this feature which differentiates the <i>open</i>EHR approach. The classes do
have attributes which ensure that it is clear how the information in the EHR was
collected, by whom, and who took responsibility for it - as well as meeting many
other complex requirements. The clinical or demographic requirements are met
through designing archetypes for the purpose.</p>

<p>When designing archetypes it is important to consider which of the above
classes best represent the aspect which you are trying to represent.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/extract_when.htm">When to use an Extract</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/composition_when.htm">When to use a
    Composition</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/section_when.htm">When to use a Section</a></li>
  <li><a href="../../openEHR/entry_when.htm">When to use an Entry</a></li>
</ul>

<p>A further consideration is required. Is the concept that you are endeavouring
to represent in an archetype a specialisation of a concept that has already been
represented in an accepted archetype. If so, it may be more appropriate to <a href="specialise.htm">specialise</a>
that archetype rather than create a new one. The advantage of specialisation is
that data based on the specialised archetype will be returned in a query based
on the parent archetype. For example, as diagnosis is a specialisation of
problem, all diagnoses will be returned when seeking all the problems of a
person.</p>
