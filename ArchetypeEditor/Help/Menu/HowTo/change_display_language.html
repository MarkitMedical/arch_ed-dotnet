<h1>View the archetype in a particular language</h1>
<br>
You can use the <a href="../../Menu/language_menu.html">Language menu</a>
or the <a href="../../Screens/languages_terminologies_screen.html">Languages
and terminology screen</a> to change the display language of the
archetype. If the language you require is not available you need to <a
 href="translate.htm">translate the archetype</a>.<br>
The display language of the archetype is a representation of the
archetype in a particular language - importantly there is no language
primacy ie terms are represented by surrogates which are translated
into multiple languages.<br>
You can safely add a language to the archetype and have it reviewed by
another.<br>
