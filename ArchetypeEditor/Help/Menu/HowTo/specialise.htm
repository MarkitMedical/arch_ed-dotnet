<title>Specialise an archetype</title>

<h1>Specialise an archetype</h1>

<p>The advantage of specialisation is that data based on the specialised
archetype may be returned in a query based on the parent archetype. Examples of
this are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>diagnosis is a specialisation of problem, so all diagnoses will be
    returned when seeking all the problems from which a person is or has
    suffered</li>
  <li>birth weight is a specialisation of weight, so birth weights will be
    returned in a query seeking all recorded weights</li>
</ul>
<p>The converse is not true i.e. a search for all birth weights will not find
the weights.</p>
<p>To specialise an archetype, choose Menu &gt; File &gt; Specialise and confirm
that you wish to proceed.</p>
<p>You will then be asked to enter a word or very brief phrase to identify the
new archetype.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../Screens/images/dialog_specialise.gif" width="360" height="136"></p>
<p>In the examples above - 'diagnosis' and 'birth' would be appropriate giving
the archetype names 'problem-diagnosis' and 'weight-birth' respectively.</p>
<p>The archetype is now specialised and it is possible to <a href="Edit%20data/specialise_element.htm">specialise
an element</a> within the archetype and add new elements and clusters. It is not
possible to delete an element introduced at the level above the specialisation
unless it is optional.</p>

<p>You will notice when you open an archetype that has been specialised that the
specialisation hierarchy is shown in the <a href="../Screens/header.htm">header</a>.</p>
