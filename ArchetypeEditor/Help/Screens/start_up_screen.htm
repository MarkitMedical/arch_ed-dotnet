<h1>Start up screen</h1>
<p>The start up screen enables the user to edit and existing archetype or create
a new archetype. The screen appears when the editor is loaded, the menu File
&gt; New is chosen or Ctrl-N is pressed</p>
<h2>Edit an existing archetype</h2>
<p>This portion of the screen is only available at start up. Press the button in the lower portion of the screen and choose the archetype
using the file dialog.<br>
</p>
<h2>Create a new archetype</h2>
<p>This part of the screen is always visible - the cancel button is labelled
'exit' at start up as this exits the program.</p>
<h3>1. Choose the authority</h3>
<p>First choose the authority....at the moment only openEHR is a valid choice.
As the openEHR model is very rich this should ensure that all the clinical
requirements are captured.</p>
<h3>2. Choose the model</h3>
<p>
Then choose the model - in openEHR this means choosing between the EHR and
Demographic models. The former is for all clinical concepts, the latter is for
demographic information in a demographic server. At present the editor will only
work with the EHR model.</p>

<h3>3. Choose the component</h3>
<p>
Then choose the component. In openEHR this involves choosing between a
composition, a section or one of the three types of entry - observation,
evaluation or instruction. These are the classes in the clinical reference model
that can be archetyped. Review <a href="../HowTo/design_archetype.htm">designing
an archetype</a> if you are not sure which component to use.<br>

<h3>4. Name the archetype</h3>
<p>
Now name the archetype itself - the short concept label - using no spaces or
hyphens ('-'). Use an underline instead if you want to have a space (e.g. represent blood pressure as
'blood_pressure').<br>
