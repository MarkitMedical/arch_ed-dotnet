<h1>Entry Model Screen</h1>

<p>The Entry model screen is the main screen which contains the data
specification for an <a href="../openEHR/entry_classes.htm">ENTRY</a> archetype.
It consists of a number of screens which are on Tabs; these mimic the <i>open</i>EHR
model of an entry.</p>

<p>The upper tab contains:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="data_screen.htm">Data screen</a> - which contains the core
    information</li>
  <li>Protocol screen - which contains information about the measurement, which
    is not considered necessary for safe clinical interpretation of the data,
    but should be available to the clinician if required.</li>
  <li>State screen - which allows state information to be added in a time series
    independent of the data.</li>
</ul>
<p>The check boxes have to be ticked to show these screens, and they may be
removed by unchecking these boxes.</p>

<p>For example - the blood pressure archetype contains information about the
device and the cuff used to measure the blood pressure in the protocol. State
data may be added on a different history model when there is a complex
relationship between the state information and the data, such as in an exercise
ECG. If 'Person State with history' is checked it is not possible to add state
information as part of the data (i.e. only one set of state data is possible
with any observation).</p>
