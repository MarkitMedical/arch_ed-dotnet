<title>When to use an EVALUATION</title>

<h1>When to use an EVALUATION</h1>
<p>An <a href="entry_classes.htm#evaluation">EVALUATION</a> is used when the
information the data has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The key data relates to information generated by the clinician</li>
  <li>The key data is based on other information which has been directly
    observed or measured</li>
  <li>The key data is usually based on some sort of clinical extrapolation or
    assessment</li>
  <li>It is not sensible to have a time series of such data</li>
  <li>It is not logical to have an interval measurement of such data</li>
  <li>The concept of a 'modal value' makes little or no sense in relation to a
    single patient or data subject, particularly within a single composition</li>
</ul>
<p>The present <i>open</i>EHR approach is to use this class for information of
this type even when it is reported second-hand by a patient or data subject -
for example when a patient reports that they have a family history of a
condition, it is still a meta-observation, the diagnosis was generated by a
clinician, and the recording of a family history of heart disease requires some
sort of assessment.</p>
