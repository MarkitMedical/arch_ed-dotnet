<title>Set constraints on text</title>

<h1>Set constraints on text</h1>
<p>There are a range of constraints that can be set on text.</p>
<h1>Free text</h1>
<p><img border="1" src="../../../Screens/images/constraint_text_free.gif" width="401" height="234"></p>
<p>Checking the Text radio button on the left sets the text constraint to free
text. It is possible to add allowable text strings to this constraint by
pressing the [+] button. These are not coded in any way. The [-] button removes
the choice.</p>
<h2>Internal codes</h2>
<p><img border="0" src="../../../Screens/images/constraint_text_internal.gif" width="395" height="235"></p>
<p>When choices are added as internal codes, they are coded and can be
translated into all available languages. They can also be bound to external
terminologies for importing and exporting information as required. An additon
button [...] enables reuse of a term already in the archetype.</p>
<h2>Terminology</h2>
<p><img border="1" src="../../../Screens/images/constraint_text_terminology.gif" width="408" height="167"></p>
<p>Finally, the constraint may relate to an external terminology - again an
acXXXX code is created which can link to that terminology and return the set of
terms; the wording here only describes the sort of constraint. The actual
constraint is described in the '<a href="../../add_constraint_binding.htm">constraint
binding</a>'.</p>
