<title>When to use an EXTRACT</title>
</head>

<h1>When to use an EXTRACT</h1>
<p>An EXTRACT is a collection of <a href="composition.htm"> COMPOSITIONs</a> which can be transferred from one
EHR to another. These compositions may already exist in the 'sending' EHR or may
be created especially for the communication. If you are trying to represent a
communication between clinicians - from one EHR to another EHR - it will always
involve an extract. An archetype is not required to create an Extract, rather to
set what the Extract might or must contain.</p>
<p>Examples of Extracts are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discharge summary</li>
  <li>Referral communication</li>
  <li>Health summaries communicated to a central organisation</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, if you are attempting to standardise or constrain complex and
variable communication between clinicians, involving information already held in
the EHR - then you probably need to create an archetype for the EXTRACT class. </p>
