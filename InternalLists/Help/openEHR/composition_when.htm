<h1>When to use a COMPOSITION</h1>
<p>A <a href="composition.htm">COMPOSITION</a> is a container class which has is
committed to the EHR. It is used to represent documents or information which is
required to be committed to the EHR as a unit. Any information which is to be
collected and changed independent of other information in the EHR requires its
own composition.</p>
<p>Examples of Compositions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documents created by a clinician and stored in the EHR</li>
  <li>Laboratory results and report</li>
  <li>ECG results and report</li>
  <li>A Problem list which is separate from any particular document</li>
  <li>A Family History list which is separate from any particular document.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, if you are trying to standardise information that is usually
committed as a 'document' or at least by a clinician at one time, then you
probably need to use a COMPOSITION.</p>
