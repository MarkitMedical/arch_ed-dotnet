<h1>When to use an INSTRUCTION</h1>
<p>An <a href="entry_classes.htm#instruction"> INSTRUCTION</a> is used for data which determines what will happen in the
future - what is planned.&nbsp; An instruction has the following features:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It contains data about when the timing of health care events</li>
  <li>It contains workflow information - has it been commenced, has it been
    cancelled or has it been completed</li>
  <li>It contains information about the condition or conditions for the event to
    take place - based on date and time, or other values</li>
  <li>It may contain information about what processing is required, particularly
    in relation to notifications</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a medication order is recorded as an instruction whereas a
medication administration is recorded as an observation. The former has
information about when it is to commence, what the frequency of administration
is - the later has only information about one instance of this order being
administered.</p>
