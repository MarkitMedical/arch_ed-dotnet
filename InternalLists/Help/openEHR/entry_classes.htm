<h1>ENTRY classes</h1>
<p>In the <i>open</i>EHR reference model a 'composition' or document
contains
one or more organising 'sections' - which themselves contain 'entries'.
The
ENTRY class of the <i>open</i>EHR reference model is like the leaf
node of the
document and contains the information - the blood pressure, the
assessment, the
diagnosis, the medication order. Importantly, <b><i>'entries' can be
interpreted
independent of the composition or the section within which they are
located</i></b>
- this is a key principle of the <i>open</i>EHR methodology and is
very
important for automatic processing of EHR data.</p>
<p>All Entry classes contain:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <b>DATA</b> part which contains the core information e.g. the
systolic and diastolic pressures when measuring a blood pressure.</li>
  <li><a name="state"></a>a <b>STATE</b> part which contains
information about the subject of data at the time the information was
collected, and this information is required for safe clinical
interpretation of the core information. An example is the position of
the patient at the time of measuring a blood pressure.</li>
  <li><a name="protocol"></a>a <b>PROTOCOL</b> part which contains
information on how the information was gathered or measured, and any
other information that is not required for safe clinical interpretation
of the core information. By default, this information will not be
displayed in the primary view of the EHR.</li>
</ul>
<p>ENTRY, which is an abstract type (and does not exist in <i>open</i>EHR
compatible data) has 3 concrete subtypes:</p>
<h2><a name="evaluation"></a>EVALUATION</h2>
<p>Evaluations are 'meta-observations' - ideas, labels or views which
arise
within the clinician's mind, which involve interpretation of
observations and
formulation into a new form. These data do not require a time model,
and there
is no valid concept of average, maximum or modal values of this concept
when
considering an individual data subject. Examples of evaluations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Diagnosis</li>
  <li>Assessment</li>
  <li>Family history</li>
  <li>Problem</li>
  <li>Issue</li>
  <li>Adverse reaction</li>
</ul>
<p>As EVALUATIONs have no history model (see observation), all dates
and times
must be expressed within the archetype. Hence, a diagnosis archetype
will have
'date of onset', 'date of resolution' etc as specific data points in
the
evaluation archetype.</p>
<h2><a name="observation"></a>OBSERVATION</h2>
<p>Observations are the 'uninterpreted' or raw information - the
clinical
observations. These may be reported by the patient, found by a
clinician or by
an instrument. These data will usually have a valid concept of average,
maximum,
delta/change or modal value. In fact, one test of whether information
should be
stored in an OBSERVATION is 'Does the idea of a modal value of this
data make
sense?'. In addition to the Data, State and Protocol parts described
above,
observations have:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a <b>HISTORY</b> part which contains information about the
timing of the observation and the 'width' of the information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of observations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blood pressure</li>
  <li>ECG</li>
  <li>Weight</li>
  <li>Height</li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="instruction"></a>INSTRUCTION</h2>
<p>Instructions are statements about what should happen in the future
and
consist of two parts - an action specification - which is in fact a
composition
or an observation archetype - and information about the timing and
status of the
action or recording that is to be completed.</p>
<h2>Archetypes</h2>
<p>Entry classes may be archetyped; allowing the author to specify the
constraints on, for example, the DATA, STATE and PROTOCOL parts of the
archetype.</p>
