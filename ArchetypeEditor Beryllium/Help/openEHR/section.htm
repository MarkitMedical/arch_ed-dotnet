<h1>SECTION class</h1>
<p>In the <i>open</i>EHR reference model a 'composition' or document contains
one or more organising 'sections' - which themselves contain 'entries'. The
SECTION class of the <i>open</i>EHR reference model is an organising
'container'. The purpose of a section is to bring together information in a way
that is useful for clinicians - it provides the 'clinical interoperability'.
Importantly, a SECTION does not alter the meaning of any of the ENTRY classes
held within it - this is a crucial principle when working with the <i>open</i>EHR
architecture - and enables information to be organised in the manner that is
suitable for the primary purpose it is collected - while&nbsp; ensuring that it
can safely be re-used for secondary purposes.</p>
<p>SECTION classes consist of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Further SECTION classes; or</li>
  <li>Slots which allow some or all ENTRY classes or SECTION classes to be
    contained at this point at run-time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Section classes can be archetyped; that is to say, you can create an
archetype that states the 'constraints' about what sections are contained within
a particular section, the cardinality of these sections as well as what sections
and entries may be added beneath the section at run-time.</p>
